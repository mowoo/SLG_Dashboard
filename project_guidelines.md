# Project Guidelines & Important Reminders

This file serves as a living document for project standards, critical reminders, and domain-specific rules.

## Data & Terminology
1. **Weekly Merit (戰功本週) vs. Total Merit (戰功總量)**
   - **Crucial Distinction**: "Weekly Merit" (戰功本週) is a distinct column in the raw data and is NOT the same as "Total Merit" (戰功總量).
   - **Display Rule**: When displaying statistics based on "Weekly Merit", the frontend table header MUST explicitly be labeled as "戰功本週" (Weekly Merit). Do not confuse it with Total Merit.
   - **Logic**: Ensure logic targeting "Weekly Merit" uses the correct column (`戰功本週`) and not `戰功總量`.

## General Development
